1)What is meant by FlumeNG ?

Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available service for efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log data.
It has a simple and flexible architecture based on streaming data flows. 
It is robust and fault tolerant with reliable mechanisms and many failover and recovery mechanisms. 
It uses a simple extensible data model that allows for online analytic applications.
This work currently resides on a separate branch by the name flume-728 and is informally referred to as Flume NG.

2)Can Flume provides 100 % reliability to the data flow?

Apache Flume provides end to end reliability because of its transactional approach in data flow.
Flume uses channel-based transactions to guarantee reliable message delivery.
This channel is responsible to pass reliably from end to end flow.

3)Can Flume can distributes data to multiple destinations? 

Flume supports the flow from one source to multiple channel and multiple destionations.
The dataflow from one source to multiple channels is known as fan-out flow.
This dataflow process is achieved through multiplexing.

4)Explain about the different channel types in Flume. And which channel type is faster?

The different channel types in Flume:

MEMORY Channel:Events are read from the source into memory and passed to the sink.
JDBC Channel:It stores the events in an embedded Derby database.
FILE Channel:It writes the contents to a file on the file system after reading the event from a source. 
MEMORY Channel is the fastest channel among these but has the risk of data loss.
